### All goals

### [Ghana SDGs Indicator Baseline Report 2018, 6 September 2018](http://www.gh.undp.org/content/dam/ghana/docs/Reports/UNDP_GH_IGC_SDGs_%20Indicator_%20Baseline_Report_2018.pdf).
This is the first Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Indicator Baseline report for Ghana. The report provides a baseline status for a set of SDGs indicators and serves as a reference point for tracking progress on the achievement of the SDGs and the corresponding Africa Union’s Agenda 2063.

### [Ghana’s SDG Budget Baseline Report, 2018, 9 August 2018](https://www.mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/news/Ghana%27s-SDG-Budget-Baseline-Report-Aug-09-18.pdf). 
This report serves as a template for a series of annual SDG-budgeting reports. The primary purpose of this baseline report is threefold. First, to start developing a methodology that provides a more proactive and collaborative SDGs integrated budgeting process, within and among Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Second, to develop techniques that make future tracking of annual and cumulative funding in the budget more accurate. These will be from various sources that support the SDGs, targets and indicators. Finally, to build the baseline for a report-series that combines government financing flows with impact data based on the SDGs indicators from the National Statistical System. Ultimately, the aim is to support the process towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. The theme of the 2018 budget is “Putting Ghana Back to Work”.

### [UN Ghana Sustainable Development Partnership Framework with Ghana 2018-2022, June 2018](http://gh.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/ghana/docs/Delivering%20as%20One/UNCT-GH-UNSDP-2018.pdf)
This document, the United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership (UNSDP) 2018-2022, reflects Ghana’s national goals and its commitments to global development initiatives and sets out the UN system’s collective contributions to help the Government and other stakeholders achieve these goals. In particular the UNSDP is aligned to The Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, 2017–2024, which sets out a vision for agricultural modernization, industrial diversification, and youth employment; embeds national strategies to localise and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; and articulates a self - reliant pathway to economic transformation and inclusive growth. The UNSDP also reflects the findings of the UN’s Common Country Assessment (2016) of the underlying development challenges in Ghana and of the Human Rights Assessment (2016) to identify who is at risk of not having their human rights protected and thus of being left behind.

### [Sustainable Development Goals in Ghana, November 2017](http://gh.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/ghana/docs/SDGs/UNCT-GH-SDGs-in-Ghana-Avocacy-Messages-2017.pdf). 
This publication suggests why each of the goals should matter to us and what we can do, as individuals to contribute to their successful implementation in Ghana and to ensure that no one is left behind.

### Strategic documentation that the SDGs also support
[National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, Ghana 2018-2022](http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/publications/NSDS%20II%20Ghana_Revised_16.03.18.pdf)  This is a comprehensive strategic document which seeks to guide the evolution of the National Statistical System (NSS) to enable it to produce the statistical knowledge the country needs in order to fulfil its development potential. This National Strategy for the Development of Statistics is primarily concerned with setting a vision for the next 5 years (2018‐ 2022) and providing milestones that the NSS must reach in order to make that vision a reality. This strategy seeks to create a system which is capable of being responsive to users’ needs by providing a basis for results‐oriented strategic management of the NSS and acting as a framework to mobilise and manage resources.
