This is Ghana's National Reporting Platform (NRP) for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The NRP is for disseminating  data on the SDGs indicators to help track Ghana's progress in accomplishing the SDGs and other development goals. 

Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), as part of its legal mandate as the National Statistical Office of Ghana per the Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003), is responsible for the development, collation and reporting of Ghana data for the SDGs indicators, and for reporting Ghana's progress in achieving them.

GSS is working in collaboration with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and other stakeholders within the National Statistical System (NSS) to produce data for the SDGs.

The data on the NRP is user-friendly as it is presented in open, transparent, accessible and re-usable formats. Other key features of the NRP include interactive maps, as well as metadata which describe the data provided.

The NRP is still at an Alpha stage in development. As a result, it is still 'work in progress'.

The NRP is also linked to the GSS website which can be accessed at https://statsghana.gov.gh/
