This is Ghana's National Reporting Platform (NRP) for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The website is for disseminating data on the SDGs indicators to help track Ghana's progress in accomplishing the SDGs and other development goals. It was developed with the support of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), UK.

Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), as part of its legal mandate as the National Statistical Office of Ghana per the Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003), is responsible for the development, collation and reporting of Ghana data for the SDGs indicators, and for reporting Ghana's progress in achieving them. 

GSS is working in collaboration with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and with other stakeholders within the National Statistical System (NSS) to produce data for the SDGs.

The NRP is also linked to the GSS website which can be accessed at https://statsghana.gov.gh/.

If you have any feedback on this National Reporting Platform or Ghana SDGs data, then kindly contact us at sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh. 

The answers to some general questions are also available on our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) tab.
