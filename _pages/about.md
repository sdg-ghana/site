This is Ghana's National Reporting Platform (NRP) for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The website is for disseminating data on the SDGs indicators to help track Ghana's progress in accomplishing the SDGs and other development goals. 

Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), as part of its legal mandate as the National Statistical Office of Ghana per the Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003), is responsible for the development, collation and reporting of Ghana data for the SDGs indicators, and for reporting on Ghana's progress in achieving them. GSS is working in collaboration with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and other stakeholders within the National Statistical System (NSS) to produce data for the SDGs and other development indicators.

The NRP is still at an Alpha stage in development. As a result, it is still 'work in progress'. The platform is also linked to the GSS website which can be accessed at www.statsghana.gov.gh.  [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/).

The answers to some frequently asked questions are also available on our FAQs tab.

If you have any feedback on the NRP or Ghana SDG data, kindly contact us at sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh.
