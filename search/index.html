The report, the second since 2019, is under the leadership of the National Development Planning Commission.22 Aug 2022\n\nGhana’s 2021 SDGs Budget Report\nThe 2021 SDGs Budget Report is a continuation of the efforts of the Government of Ghana to evaluate and define the funding gap for the SDGs in order to establish a financing mechanism that enables the country to fund and execute the Global Goals as expected.\n\nGhana’s Budget Credibility and the Sustainable Development Goals\nGhana’s efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 face major challenges, with rapid progress still needed in sectors related to the goals on hunger, gender equity and health. To accelerate progress toward development goals, Ghana needs to effectively mobilize domestic and international financing for programs that can address these challenges. National budgets are central to these efforts. This brief therefore looks at budget credibility patterns from 2018 to 2020 in seven key sectors that relate to 10 SDG goals, using available budget data from ministries as a proxy for SDG spending in the absence of more formal tracking systems for budget execution information on SDG spending. This analysis aims to show how Ghana’s current performance on budget credibility can potentially impact wider efforts to achieve the SDGs, and provides recommendations for how the government, development partners and civil society can expand awareness and action about budget credibility in SDG and development goal discussions.\n\nGhana SDGs Indicator Baseline Report 2018, 6 September 2018.\nThis is the first Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Indicator Baseline report for Ghana. The report provides a baseline status for a set of SDGs indicators and serves as a reference point for tracking progress on the achievement of the SDGs and the corresponding Africa Union’s Agenda 2063.\n\nGhana’s SDG Budget Baseline Report, 2018, 9 August 2018.\nThis report serves as a template for a series of annual SDG-budgeting reports. The primary purpose of this baseline report is threefold. First, to start developing a methodology that provides a more proactive and collaborative SDGs integrated budgeting process, within and among Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Second, to develop techniques that make future tracking of annual and cumulative funding in the budget more accurate. These will be from various sources that support the SDGs, targets and indicators. Finally, to build the baseline for a report-series that combines government financing flows with impact data based on the SDGs indicators from the National Statistical System. Ultimately, the aim is to support the process towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. The theme of the 2018 budget is “Putting Ghana Back to Work”.\n\nUN Ghana Sustainable Development Partnership Framework with Ghana 2018-2022, June 2018\nThis document, the United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership (UNSDP) 2018-2022, reflects Ghana’s national goals and its commitments to global development initiatives and sets out the UN system’s collective contributions to help the Government and other stakeholders achieve these goals. In particular the UNSDP is aligned to The Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, 2017–2024, which sets out a vision for agricultural modernization, industrial diversification, and youth employment; embeds national strategies to localise and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; and articulates a self - reliant pathway to economic transformation and inclusive growth. The UNSDP also reflects the findings of the UN’s Common Country Assessment (2016) of the underlying development challenges in Ghana and of the Human Rights Assessment (2016) to identify who is at risk of not having their human rights protected and thus of being left behind.\n\nSustainable Development Goals in Ghana, November 2017.\nThis publication suggests why each of the goals should matter to us and what we can do, as individuals to contribute to their successful implementation in Ghana and to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\n“The New Global Goals Fly High in Ghana”, UNDP Biannual Newsletter, January 2016\n\nStrategic documentation that the SDGs also support\nNational Strategy for the Development of Statistics, Ghana 2018-2022\nThis is a comprehensive strategic document which seeks to guide the evolution of the National Statistical System (NSS) to enable it to produce the statistical knowledge the country needs in order to fulfil its development potential. This National Strategy for the Development of Statistics is primarily concerned with setting a vision for the next 5 years (2018‐ 2022) and providing milestones that the NSS must reach in order to make that vision a reality. This strategy seeks to create a system which is capable of being responsive to users’ needs by providing a basis for results‐oriented strategic management of the NSS and acting as a framework to mobilise and manage resources.\n\nAfrican Union Agenda 2063\nThis is a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years. Its builds on, and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development.\n\nAll stakeholder forums\n\nData Production for SDG indicators in Ghana, March 2017.\nThis report presents the current situation in Ghana, regarding data production for SDG indicators, as understood by Ghana Statistical Service. These outcomes are based on a series of consultations with stakeholders.\n\nSDG Indicator Brief Ghana Volume 5, 17 April 2017 This brief provides data and indicators available from the fourth round of the PMA2020 survey in Ghana, conducted in 2015\n\nGhana’s Data for Sustainable Development Roadmap Forum, 5-6th April 2017. This report summarises the outcomes from a data forum that brought together a diverse set of data producers and users, as well as innovators in the field to discuss the way forward, including through exploring how new technologies and approaches can be used to strengthen the data ecosystem in Ghana\n\nGoal 4 Quality Education\nAn Assessment of Sustainable Development Goal Four (SDG 4), In Relation to the Standard of Basic Education in Ghana, July 2017\n\nInclusive and equitable quality education form an integral part of building a society. The quest of Sustainable Development Goal Four (4), ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all is therefore very important. This academic thesis seeks to assess the SDG Four (4) in relation to the standard of basic education in Ghana. The core  objectives  of  this  work  were  to  find  out  the  extent  to  which  the  various  Educational Reforms  have  helped  solve  the  issue  of  quality  basic  education  in  Ghana.  Generally speaking, the research conceives that the attainment of SDG Four (4) is very important for Ghana’s development. The research revealed that over the past eight (8) years, the standard of quality basic education in the country has been decreasing. Ghana is making considerable progress towards attainment of the SDG\n","id":""},"/site/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/goals/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/goals/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/reporting-status/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/reporting-status/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/indicators.json":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/indicators.json","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/search/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/search/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/offline.html":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/offline.html","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/manifest.json":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/manifest.json","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/service-worker.js":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site/service-worker.js","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/site/12-3-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/site/12-3-1/","title":"Indicator 12.3.1 -
